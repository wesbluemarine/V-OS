## V\OS README

Vitruvian is a modern operating system written in C++.

V\OS aims to provide a user experience that is free from unneeded complexities
while still retaining the power of the linux kernel.

#### Video backends

* Support for linux framebuffer.

#### Pre-requisite software

* gcc >= 8
* ninja
* cmake >= 3.13
* libinput >= 1.10

```
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build libfreetype6-dev libinput-dev git autoconf automake texinfo flex bison build-essential unzip zip less zlib1g-dev libtool mtools gcc-multilib
```

#### Getting the source code

git clone https://github.com/Barrett17/V-OS.git

#### Building V\OS

After cloning the repo, open a Terminal and enter in the sources directory.

```
mkdir generated.x86/
cd generated.x86/
../configure
ninja -j2
```
#### How to start
In order to start you need to run the following commands from the generated.x64 folder:

```bash
./src/apps/testharness/clean_shm.sh
./generated.x86/src/servers/registrar/registrar &
./generated.x86/src/servers/app/app_server &
./generated.x86/src/servers/input/input_server & 
./generated.x86/src/apps/deskbar/Deskbar &
```

#### FAQ 

1.  **app_server quit with the following message: could not inizialize font manager**

This means that  the app_server can't find the fonts. If you have them make sure to copy the fonts folder in /os/system/data

2. **I tried to start it but when i launch it i just get the background and it quit immediately after**

That is normal, and even if it looks like that it has quitted, it is not true, and is running correctly.

Contributing to the project is open to anyone, feel free to send a pull request.
